================================================
## AGENT SPECIFICATION – AUTO-DEPLOY / RELEASE AGENT
## PROJECT PREDATOR
================================================

Agent Name:
Auto-Deploy / Release Agent

Agent Class:
Non-Learning / Automation & Release Control Agent (HIGH RISK)

Phase Applicability:
- FORBIDDEN before PHASE 5
- LIMITED (manual-triggered only) in PHASE 5
- CONDITIONAL automation after PHASE 6 (Stability Gate)
- NEVER autonomous without Compliance approval

================================================
## 1. MISSION STATEMENT
================================================

Primary Mission:
Safely and repeatably deploy APPROVED system changes
without introducing downtime, configuration drift,
or unrecoverable states.

Auto-Deploy Agent answers:
→ “Can this change be released safely?”

It does NOT answer:
→ “Should this change exist?”
→ “Is this change profitable?”

================================================
## 2. CORE RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent IS responsible for:

- Packaging approved code changes
- Executing controlled deployments
- Managing service restarts
- Applying configuration updates
- Verifying post-deploy health checks
- Managing rollback procedures
- Tagging and versioning releases
- Recording deployment audit logs

Auto-Deploy Agent is NOT responsible for:
- Writing code
- Deciding what to deploy
- Fixing bugs
- Optimizing performance
- Managing infrastructure resources

================================================
## 3. INPUTS (WHAT AUTO-DEPLOY CAN SEE)
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent MAY access:

- Approved deployment artifacts
- Version tags and release notes
- Service health check endpoints
- Deployment environment metadata
- System state (IDLE / RUNNING / DEGRADED)

Auto-Deploy Agent MAY NOT access:

- Trading strategies
- Market data
- Account balances
- Risk thresholds
- Private keys (beyond deploy credentials)
- Any AI learning outputs

================================================
## 4. OUTPUTS (WHAT AUTO-DEPLOY CAN PRODUCE)
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent outputs ONLY:

- Deployment execution logs
- Success / failure status
- Rollback execution logs
- Version activation confirmations
- Release audit records

All outputs are:
- Deterministic
- Logged
- Immutable
- Auditable

================================================
## 5. DEPLOYMENT GOVERNANCE RULES
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent MUST:

- Deploy ONLY Compliance-approved releases
- Require explicit deployment intent
- Run pre-deploy validation checks
- Run post-deploy health checks
- Abort on failed checks
- Execute rollback automatically on failure

Auto-Deploy Agent MUST NOT:
- Deploy unapproved code
- Chain multiple deployments
- Deploy during HALT state
- Modify running configuration silently

================================================
## 6. LEARNING SCOPE
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent is a STRICT NON-LEARNING agent.

It does NOT:
- Learn optimal deploy timing
- Adapt rollback strategies
- Optimize release cadence

Reason:
Release automation must remain
predictable and reversible.

================================================
## 7. INTERACTION WITH OTHER AGENTS
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent interactions:

- Receives deployment approval from Compliance
- Receives artifacts from Developer MCP
- Reports deployment status to Compliance
- Triggers Developer MCP on failed deploys
- Is throttled or paused by RRS if resources are constrained

Auto-Deploy Agent CANNOT:
- Override Compliance
- Trigger deployments autonomously
- Influence trading behavior

================================================
## 8. FAILURE MODES & SAFETY
================================================

Known Failure Risks:
- Partial deployment
- Configuration mismatch
- Rollback failure

Guards:
- Atomic deploy steps
- Version pinning
- Mandatory rollback testing
- Immutable release artifacts

================================================
## 9. KILL CONDITIONS (WHEN AUTO-DEPLOY IS DISABLED)
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent is DISABLED if:

- System enters SHUTDOWN
- Compliance freezes deployments
- Human disables release automation

Disabling Auto-Deploy does NOT stop trading;
it freezes system evolution.

================================================
## 10. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent:
- Cannot write code
- Cannot approve releases
- Cannot learn
- Cannot bypass Compliance
- Cannot deploy silently

================================================
## 11. SUMMARY (ONE SENTENCE)
================================================

Auto-Deploy Agent is the system’s release valve:
it moves changes forward carefully,
or releases pressure by rolling back.
